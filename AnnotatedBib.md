## ADRC. “Characteristics of Disasters in Oceania.” ADRC Asia, 2002,				 

[www.adrc.asia/publications/databook/ORG/databook_2002_eng/3_2_5.pdf](http://www.adrc.asia/publications/databook/ORG/databook_2002_eng/3_2_5.pdf).
<u>Summary</u>: This article describes the patterns of natural disasters that occur in or near Oceania. The Asian Disaster Reduction Center is in charge of disaster risk reduction (DRR) for the Oceania islands. They have compiled the following data regarding the disaster trends of this region. Oceania experiences just about every type of natural disaster, however a few are far more prevalent. For example, they experience windstorms and earthquakes the most. Though these disasters are more numerous, other disasters have had larger impacts on the people of Oceania, such as epidemics, which accounted for 61% of deaths due to disaster in 2002. The two disasters that affect totally affect people involve windstorms and volcanoes. The most numerous disaster has been epidemics.

<u>Analysis</u>: Fiji’s economy is consistently getting battered by natural disasters. Its location is to thank for this, and the ADRC commented “It can be concluded that in 2002, Oceania experienced both hydro meteorological and geophysical disasters, almost in equal dimensions, due to the geological location of the region,” (ADRC 1).“It is easily understood from these sections that Asia is an extremely disaster prone region of the world in terms of human loss and suffering.” One large takeaway from this article is the huge impact that epidemics have on Fiji. As a matter of fact, if you were to take a look into planning a vacation/getaway to Fiji right now, their travel websites warn of travel restrictions due to the novel coronavirus. Fiji's Department of Immigration even states "Fiji is closely monitoring the spread of the coronavirus and is prepared to pursue more stringent courses of action if deemed necessary." 

​	Fiji is taking this new virus quite seriously, likely due to their proximity to infected regions as well as their past history with viral epidemics.
