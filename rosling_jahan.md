## Rosling and Jahan Question:
Selim Jahan introduces the idea that for far too long the paradigm of economic development has dominated the idea of human development. Jahan states that while income is critical it is not an end, and that human development is about expanding the richness of life, not the richness of the economy within which human beings live. What are some of the targetted issues that Jahan examples as requiring focus throughout the world? Elaborate further on Jahan’s definition of human development. What are the different measures incorporated into the Human Development Index that serve to capture the breadth and focus of each countries’ average achievement?

Hans Rosling states that “we underestimate the tremendous social change that often precedes economic change” and proceeds to provide several examples. What were some of the examples Rosling presented where health appeared to be a precursor to wealth? What was Rosling’s warning regarding the dangers of using averages when describing development?

## Response:

Jahan emphasizes the concept of human development being OF the people, FOR the people, and BY the people. He elaborates on how specific topics need this type of focus. For example, Jahan discusses the nature of choice, or free will. He also tackles the concept of attempting to measure human development. Though it is impossible to truly perform this task, the Human Development Index (HDI) does an adequate job. Jahan even goes on to call the HDI the "crown jewel of human development." He then continues to explain how there are two different types of measures of human development: breadth measure and focus measure. He describes breadth measure as a larger scale observation, while focus measure is more of a descriptive factor.

Rosling made a big deal of highlighting how health comes before wealth. In a nutshell, he argues that a country can develop much faster if it is healthy first than if it is wealthy. The example that he applies this to is the comparison of child survivability and family income. Though these two things are directly proportional, Rosling demonstrated how an increase in income leads to a slow rise in survivability. 

Rosling spends the second half of his TED Talk discussing the dangers of using averages. By expanding a country into smaller regions, Rosling shows how large of a distribution there is relating to wealth. For example, he splits Africa up into its countries; they then reveal how there are some countries in Africa that seek aid, while others are more of a vacation destination. The problem with using averages is that Africa as a whole is neither poverty stricken nor rich: it's a mixture of both
