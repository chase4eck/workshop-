- On the topic of world distribution of income, Rosling showed how the "hump" (when looking at the Asian population) travelled from entirely in poverty to mostly middle class.
  - The data also predicts that in the future, the vast majority of the population will end up in the middle.
- Child survivability is directly proportional to income.
  - Rosling then splits Africa up into its countries; they reveal how there are some countries in Africa that seek aid, while others are a vacation destination.
- A country can develop much faster if it is healthy first than if it is wealthy first.
- Rosling also splits up countries into their classes; this shows a large distribution of both low and high income/ child survivability.
