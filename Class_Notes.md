# Class Notes

## What is human development?
- It is development OF the people, FOR the people, and BY the people.
  - First said by Lincoln at Gettysburg.
- The focus of human development must change from income to bettering living conditions.
- Highlights the concept of choice.
- Crown jewel of human development: the HDI.
  - It is essentially a measure of human development
  -  Cannot completely measure human development though; this is not really possible
- 2 types of measures of human development: breadth measure and focus measure.
  - Focus measure is more of the descriptive factor.

## HDR 2015 Discussion
- Discussing volunteer work, family work, and jobs/employment together.
  - Also includes artistic work: contributes to social cohesion.


## Debunking Myths About the Third World
- "Who are 'we' and 'them'?"
  - 'Them' being the 3rd world countries.
- As fertility rate (or family size) increases, lifespan decreases.
  - The study done w/ the smartest students from Sweden; occurred because of preconceived notions.
- On the topic of world distribution of income, Rosling showed how the "hump" (when looking at the Asian population) travelled from entirely in poverty to mostly middle class.
  - The data also predicts that in the future, the vast majority of the population will end up in the middle.
- Child survivability is directly proportional to income.
  - Rosling then splits Africa up into its countries; they reveal how there are some countries in Africa that seek aid, while others are a vacation destination.
- A country can develop much faster if it is healthy first than if it is wealthy first.
- Rosling also splits up countries into their classes; this shows a large distribution of both low and high income/ child survivability.
- "The improvement of the world must be highly contextualized." - 14:44
  - Need more detail on a regional level.
- Gapminder: used to connect big data/ databases to visual representations for public access.
