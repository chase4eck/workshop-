# Class Notes

## What is human development?
- It is development OF the people, FOR the people, and BY the people.
  - First said by Lincoln at Gettysburg.
- The focus of human development must change from income to bettering living conditions.
- Highlights the concept of choice.
- Crown jewel of human development: the HDI.
  - It is essentially a measure of human development
  -  Cannot completely measure human development though; this is not really possible
- 2 types of measures of human development: breadth measure and focus measure.
  - Focus measure is more of the descriptive factor.

## HDR 2015 Discussion
- Discussing volunteer work, family work, and jobs/employment together.
  - Also includes artistic work: contributes to social cohesion.


## Debunking Myths About the Third World
- "Who are 'we' and 'them'?"
  - 'Them' being the 3rd world countries.
- As fertility rate (or family size) increases, lifespan decreases.
  - The study done w/ the smartest students from Sweden; occurred because of preconceived notions.
- On the topic of world distribution of income, Rosling showed how the "hump" (when looking at the Asian population) travelled from entirely in poverty to mostly middle class.
  - The data also predicts that in the future, the vast majority of the population will end up in the middle.
- Child survivability is directly proportional to income.
  - Rosling then splits Africa up into its countries; they reveal how there are some countries in Africa that seek aid, while others are a vacation destination.
- A country can develop much faster if it is healthy first than if it is wealthy first.
- Rosling also splits up countries into their classes; this shows a large distribution of both low and high income/ child survivability.
- "The improvement of the world must be highly contextualized." - 14:44
  - Need more detail on a regional level.
- Gapminder: used to connect big data/ databases to visual representations for public access.


## High Resolution Global Gridded Data for Use in Population Studies
- Using non-spatial population data to transfer census data into grid-cell data
  - GRUMP uses this data along w/ satellite info to build its dataset
- There are four ‘base’ standardised 100 m tiled datasets and 30 arc-second global mosaic derivations
  - 30 arc-second global mosaic derivations = 1km datasets
- Some useful info:
  - Base dataset creation involves processing raster topography data with vector country boundary data using a Geographical Information System (GIS) and other geospatial software. Raster images consist of a grid of pixels of particular size (spatial resolution), each pixel having a discrete (x,y) location and value. Raster images are commonly used in GIS applications, where they can represent digital elevation or terrain models of the Earth’s surface (i.e., topography). Vector datasets represent data slightly differently, utilising points (or nodes), and (in turn) lines and polygons, to represent (x,y) positions in space. Vector data can be assigned attribute information where required, and are well suited to representing boundary data.
- Four 100 m resolution datasets form the basis of the archive:
  1. Topography
  2. Standardised
  3. Gridded
  4. Clipped to country coastal boundaries
  - These create a resolution of 1 km and tiles of 100 m
#### There's a lot of math and computing involved in transferring this data into grid cells that I do not understand
- Each grid can be separated into a stack of layers to better understand how the data is making up that tile
- Some examples of layers:
  - Precipitation, land-slope, nightlights, population count, population density, water, land cover
- These layers come from a multitude of data-sites
  - For example, OSM (open street map) provides the majority of info about streets, waterways, railroads, and airports



## Development as Freedom (Amartya Sen)
- Development: the process of expanding peoples' freedoms
  - Similarly, development requires the removal sources of 'unfreedom'
    - Such as tyranny, poverty, intolerance, repression, etc.
- 2 reasons freedom is central to the process of development
  - The evaluative reason: progress should be considered the enhancement of freedoms
  - The effectiveness reason: achievement of development is thoroughly based on the free agency of the people
- The freedom to interchange words, gifts, and goods leads to a free market
  - This freedom "has a basic role in social living" (Sen 7).
  - Anectdote about Kader Mia emphasizes how his economic unfreedom lead to his death.
    - Went looking for work in a hostile area; knifed in the back
  - "Economic unfreedom can breed social unfreedom" (Sen 8).
- 5 types of freedoms:
1. Political freedoms
2. Economic facilities
3. Social opportunities
4. Transparency guarentees
5. Protective security
  - Each of these serve to increase the general capabilities of the people
  - These freedoms must be considered together, as a group
- "Wealth is evidently not the good we are seeking; for it is merely useful and for the sake of something else." (Aristotle)
  - Economic growth can not be treated as an end; development is more about expanding our freedoms
- There is a very evident connection between authoritarian rule and famine
  - Example with North Korean & Sudan being "famine-leauge"
- When talking about freedom, we must consider both the processes that allow freedom and the opportunities that people have.
- Sen highlights the importance of having the freedom to do things that one values in order to have valuable outcomes.
  - Freedom allows people to have a greater impact on society & even the world
- Sen uses the term agent as someone who brings about change and who has their own set of values and objectives that they strive to achieve
- Sen considers how unemployment is not just the loss of income; it's also social exclusion, loss of self-reliance & self-confidence, and psychological/ physical health
- There is a large variation between the survival rates of white males in the US and black males in the US.
  - Black males in the US suffer from 'relative' deprivation, compared to the white males
- Economic deprivations occur when the people lose what the market has to offer, such as lucrative opportunities
- Individual freedoms are a social product; they are a relation between social arrangements to expand individual freedoms and 
  - On top of these ideas, Sen highlights the importance of participation
- This also plays into the idea of participation in tradition, which leads to the discussion of mandatory participation vs. freedom
- There are 2 general attitudes concerning development
  1. Development as a 'fierce' process - w/ blood, sweat, and tears
  2. Development as a 'friendly' process - w/ focus on beneficial exchanges
- Primary end of development: expansion of freedoms
  - This is also the principle mean of development
  - Constitutive role: freedom enriching one's life; avoiding basic deprivations (ex. starvation); also primary end
  - Instrumental role: principal means
- Instrumental freedoms play an instrumental role in advancing the economy
1. Political freedoms: giving the people power in politics
2. Economic facilities: opportunities of the people to use economic resources
3. Social opportunities: arrangements that society makes for education, health care, etc.
4. Transparency guarentees: the openness of the people; a general trust throughout the society
5. Protective security: social safety net (ex. collecting unemployment)
- Each of these instrumental freedoms complement each other and lead to development (as the increase of freedoms)
  - Many also lead to economic growth indirectly
- Sen explains how economic growth does NOT equal development; he backs this up with data that shows no correlation between life expectancy and GNP per capita
